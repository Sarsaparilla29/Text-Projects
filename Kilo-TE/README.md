What is Kilo?

Kilo is a terminal based text editor written in C.

This is the website that walks you through how to make Kilo in C.

How do you use it?

To use kilo, insert the following command into your terminal:

./kilo [filename]

To save a file press Ctrl-S.
To close kilo press Ctrl-Q.
To search press Ctrl-F.

My goal with this project?

I would like to rewrite Kilo in the Rust programming language.
The main purpose of rewriting this in Rust is so that I can learn the language.
I won't be rewriting it 100% as I hope to improve upon the original but also to make it follow Vim keybindings.
